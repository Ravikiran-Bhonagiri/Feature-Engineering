        "# **Key Audio Features for Industrial Fan Noise Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "When analyzing the noise generated by industrial fans, some audio features are more crucial for detecting anomalies (e.g., wear and tear, loose components, mechanical faults). Below is an **ordered list of features** based on their significance for fan noise analysis, along with explanations for their importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1. Spectral Centroid**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - The spectral centroid indicates where the majority of the frequency energy is concentrated.\n",
        "  - Abnormal fan sounds often have an upward or downward shift in the centroid due to mechanical wear, broken blades, or imbalance.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Monitor sudden increases or decreases, as these indicate changes in the frequency profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. Spectral Rolloff**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - Spectral rolloff measures the point below which 85% of the spectral energy resides.\n",
        "  - Changes in rolloff indicate whether the fan is producing higher-pitched (e.g., squealing) or lower-pitched (e.g., humming) noise.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Track for significant shifts toward higher frequencies (suggesting squeaks) or lower frequencies (suggesting slowed or unbalanced motion).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3. Spectral Bandwidth**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - Spectral bandwidth captures how spread out the frequencies are around the centroid.\n",
        "  - A narrow bandwidth typically indicates a pure, steady hum, while a wider bandwidth suggests noisy, rattling, or turbulent sounds.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Anomalies usually cause the bandwidth to widen due to mechanical irregularities.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **4. Root Mean Square (RMS) Energy**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - RMS energy reflects the overall loudness or power of the sound.\n",
        "  - Fans operating with mechanical faults often have increased or irregular RMS due to vibrations, impacts, or loose components.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Sudden spikes or consistent increases in RMS energy can indicate abnormal operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **5. Harmonic and Percussive RMS**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - The harmonic RMS captures smooth, tonal sounds, while the percussive RMS captures transient, noise-like sounds.\n",
        "  - Changes in the ratio between harmonic and percussive energy can indicate a shift from normal operation (smooth hum) to abnormal operation (clicking, knocking, or grinding).\n",
        "- **Focus:** Higher percussive RMS relative to harmonic RMS suggests mechanical impacts or loose parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **6. Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - ZCR measures the rate of sign changes in the waveform.\n",
        "  - High ZCR values indicate rapid oscillations or noise-like transients, which are typical of squeaks or other sharp, mechanical sounds.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Track for higher-than-usual ZCR values, which may indicate increased turbulence or faulty fan components.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **7. Spectral Flatness**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - Spectral flatness indicates how noise-like the sound is.\n",
        "  - Abnormal fan noises, such as rattling or grinding, tend to increase spectral flatness because they add broadband noise to the spectrum.\n",
        "- **Focus:** An increase in spectral flatness is often correlated with more chaotic or noisy sounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **8. Pitch (Fundamental Frequency)**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - The fundamental frequency reflects the base \"hum\" of the fan motor.\n",
        "  - Shifts in pitch may indicate a change in the motor speed or an issue with the fan blades.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Watch for sudden drops or rises in pitch, which may correspond to mechanical strain or failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **9. Spectral Contrast**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - Spectral contrast measures the difference between spectral peaks and valleys.\n",
        "  - Fans operating normally have consistent harmonic peaks; irregular peaks and valleys suggest the introduction of noisy components or wear.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Significant changes in contrast patterns could indicate rubbing or friction between parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **10. Attack Time and Decay Time**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - Attack time measures how quickly the sound reaches its peak, while decay time measures how long it takes for the sound to return to baseline.\n",
        "  - Changes in attack and decay times can indicate mechanical instability (e.g., loose or misaligned parts).\n",
        "- **Focus:** Track increased attack and decay times for clues about sudden changes in airflow or mechanical delays.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **11. Skewness and Kurtosis**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - Skewness indicates the asymmetry of the amplitude distribution, while kurtosis measures the \"peakedness.\"\n",
        "  - A sudden increase in skewness may indicate an increase in sharp, high-energy transients (e.g., clicking or snapping sounds).\n",
        "  - High kurtosis often corresponds to impulsive sounds caused by impacts or loose components.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Large deviations from normal values may indicate erratic behavior or impacts.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **12. Tempo (BPM)**\n",
        "- **Reason:**\n",
        "  - Tempo reflects the periodicity of recurring events.\n",
        "  - In a fan, consistent tempo corresponds to regular cycles of motion. Sudden changes may indicate speed fluctuations or faulty components.\n",
        "- **Focus:** Irregular tempo can indicate blade issues or interruptions in motor speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Summary of Focus Points:**\n",
        "- **Frequency-based features:** Spectral centroid, rolloff, and bandwidth are key indicators of fan noise anomalies.\n",
        "- **Energy-based features:** RMS, harmonic/percussive RMS, and spectral flatness indicate loudness changes and the presence of noise-like components.\n",
        "- **Temporal features:** Onset strength, attack/decay time, and skewness/kurtosis capture transient events and mechanical impacts.\n",
        "\n",
        "By prioritizing these features in your analysis, you can detect early warning signs of fan degradation or failure.\n"
